===== Advertisement on Websites =====

In the past years this topic was limited to german-speaking websites, where important news (e.g. Call for Paper, end of the Call for Papers etc.) were posted:

  * [[http://www.pro-linux.de/news/10/1/news-mitteilen.html|Pro-Linux]]
  * [[http://www.heise.de/open/Impressum-Kontakt-4768.html|Heise open]]
  * [[http://www.linux-magazin.de/Heft-Abo/Kontakt/Kontakt|Linux-Magazin]]

There are no existing contacts to international websites

==== Ikhaya ====

Ikhaya is the News-blog of the german Ubuntu users community website. In past years, Ubucon news were summarized for Ikhaya. Regular updates were published.

The Ubucon-Feed was registered with the following planets:

  * [[http://planet.ubuntuusers.de/|Planet ubuntuusers.de]]
  * [[http://osbn.de/|Open Source Blog Netzwerk]] (registered by [[user>Dee]])

===== Mailing lists =====

The most important news were posted to the following lists:

  * [[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-de-events|ubuntu-de-events]]
  * [[http://lists.ubuntu-eu.org/mailman/listinfo/ubucon-de|ubucon-de]]
  * [[http://lists.ubuntu-eu.org/mailman/listinfo/loco-de|loco-de]]
