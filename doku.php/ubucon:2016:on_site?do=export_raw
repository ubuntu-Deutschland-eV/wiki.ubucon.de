====== On Site ======

* TODO: Who organises everything on site?

===== Organisation =====

* TODO: Detail the whole registration process at the location

==== Location ====

The rooms are named after past Ubuntu release codenames. The conference schedule assigns talks to rooms.

All the important information for visitors (how to get there etc.) will be published beforehand.

==== Sponsoring ====

 * Canonical has already expressed their interest to sponsor the event again

 * The following partner companies should be contacted: bq, Meizu, Erle, Mellanox


==== Catering ====

Past events had a "flatrate" on food and drinks which was covered by the entrance fee (up to 20 â‚¬, depending on when you registered).

Will we do this again?

==== Social events ====

At past events there were guided excursions (e.g. a museum in Berlin) and organized dinners.

==== Hotels =====

Many people have asked for a list of suitable hotels, or maybe even rooms at a special Ubucon rate.
