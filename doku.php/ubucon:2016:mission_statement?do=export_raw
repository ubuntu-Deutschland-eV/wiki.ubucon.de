====== Mission Statement ======

The main goals of Ubucon 2016 are:

  * Become a place where the members of the european Ubuntu communities can meet, learn form each other, exchange ideas and hopefully create friendships

  * Create a showcase for everything (flavors, commercial products etc.) based on Ubuntu

  * Inform the general public about Ubuntu and all its flavors and subprojects

  * To be as open for everybody and anybody

  * To be as much fun as possible

What Ubucon Europe 2016 is not:

  * A “generic” event like LinuxTag, OpenRheinRuhr etc.
